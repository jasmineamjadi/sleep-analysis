# **Demographic and Health Factors on Sleep Quality**

## **Introduction**

Sleep plays a crucial role in our cognitive, physical, and emotional well-being, yet poor sleep health remains a growing global concern. Insufficient sleep is linked to impaired decision-making, mental health challenges, and chronic conditions such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This project analyzes the influence of demographic and health factors on sleep quality in an effort to gain insights that could inform effective improvement strategies.
